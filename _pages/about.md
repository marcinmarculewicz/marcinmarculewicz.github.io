Iâ€™m an astrophysicist who studies the astrophysics of supermassive black holes (Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei). 
My research is focused on a peculiar type of quasars, namely, weak emission-line quasars (WLQ), I have used the continuum fit method to constrain the global parameters of WLQ, the mass of the black hole, accretion rate, spin, and inclination. 

The continuum fitting method could tell how WLQs are described by these global parameters. The theoretical models of accretion disk continua were created to determine black hole mass and accretion rate. By comparison of estimated black hole mass with the literature, which is based on the single-epoch virial method, I have noticed an overall underestimation with a mean factor of 4-5.
