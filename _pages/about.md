Iâ€™m an astrophysicist who studies the astrophysics of supermassive black holes (Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei). 
My research is focused on a peculiar type of quasars, namely, weak emission-line quasars (WLQ), I have used the continuum fit method to constrain the global parameters of WLQ, the mass of the black hole, accretion rate, spin, and inclination. The continuum fitting method could tell how WLQs are described by these global parameters. The theoretical models of accretion disk continua were created to determine black hole mass and accretion rate. By comparing the estimated black hole mass with the literature, which is based on the single-epoch virial method, I have noticed an overall underestimation with a mean factor of 4-5. For more, please [see](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab9597).

In 2022 I started a Postdoctoral Researcher position at the Department of Astronomy, Xiamen University under the supervision of Professor Mouyuan Sun, [see](https://www.msun.space/). During my post, a few articles have been concluded. 1) Study of the origin of an abnormal absorption in SDSS J110511.15+530806.5, [see](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...668A.128M/abstract), 2) The reverberation mapping of X-ray weak quasars SDSS J153913.47+395423.4, [see](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...956..126M/abstract), 3) Marculewicz et al. 2024, in prep.

In 2024 I started a Postdoctoral Fellow position at the Physics and Astronomy Department, Wayne State University under the supervision of Professor Ed Cackett, [see](https://clasprofiles.wayne.edu/profile/ew1397).

Currently, my research is mostly focused on reverberation mapping, measurement of time delays, and accretion disk sizes (Marculewicz et al. 2024, in prep.)
